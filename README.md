# Employee Project Tracker

A fictional company that tracks employees and the projects they are working on. Each employee is assigned to a 
department and works on multiple projects. Each project has a budget and a status ("active" or "completed").

We'll analyze this data using:

- `flatMap()` — for flattening nested project lists
- Built-in `Collectors` — for grouping, counting, and averaging 
- A Custom Collector — for summarizing project statistics per department
